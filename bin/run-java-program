runProgram.sh - I made this script to execute any Java file that 
                I use. In order to use the script, just change 
                the java file, the java tester at the top of 
                the file.

# TODO: Add man pages
# TODO: Add feature to use multiple files per script. Maybe include a flag --explicit ?
# TODO: Add more user friendly features.  Maybe it would be good if the user could manipulate the script mid-sentence.
# TODO: Add better error handling features for files that might just not be there.  Maybe do that with a python script.
