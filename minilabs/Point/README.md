# Minilab Point
In Minilab Point, we will create the Point class.
## Notes
Minilab Point - Creating a point class.  Points are built out out of X and Y-coordinates.  
## Data
There are two private data declarations:
    - x - the coordinate
    - y - the coordinate
  
## Constructors
There are three different constructors employed here.
- Default constructor 
    Where the point will be: (2,-7)
- Parameterized Constructor
    Where there are parameters for both X and Y values.
- Copy Constructor
    Where we make a new Point based on an old point.  Constructor checks for null and throws IllegalArgumentExpception if the other point is null.
