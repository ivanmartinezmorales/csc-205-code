## Notes
What is an AVL tree? a AVL tree is a BST that knows to balance itself. Every node in the AVL tree has a balance factor, and the balance factor is the height of the left subtree, minus the height of the right subtree as such:

> balance_factor = left_subtree - right_subtree 

An AVL tree is considered balanced when every node has a balance factor of 0, 1, or -1.

Let's build an AVL tree.
